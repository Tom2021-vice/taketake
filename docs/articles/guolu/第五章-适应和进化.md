# Adaptation and Evolution
*适应和进化*<br />
## 1. What is evolution, natural selection, adaption, acclimation?<br />
*什么是进化、自然选择、适应、驯化？*<br />
**Evolution:** is a change of gene frequencies within a population (or species) <u>over time</u> `随时间`.<br />
**Natural selection:** The differential success `差异性成功` (survival and reproduction) of individuals within the population that results from `导致，结果` their interaction `交互作用` with their environment.<br />
**Adaption:** Adaptation is a characteristic or trait `特征` of an 
organism that increases its fitness <u>relative
to</u> `关于…的，和…比较起来` individuals that do not possess it. It is an
inherited characteristic that increases the
ability of an organism to survive and
reproduce.<br />
**Acclimation:** Adaptive phenotypic  plasticity `适应性表现型可塑性` <u>referred to as</u> `称为` Acclimation, such as growing thicker fur in winter, producing smaller leaves during the dry season and so on. and it is thought as a shift `变化` <u>in individual's range of physiological tolerances</u> `个人生理耐受性`. It's useful in responce to seasonal and other persistent `持续的` changes in conditions. Acclimation is reversible `可逆的` and takes days to weeks.  
## 2. Different types of NS? 
*自然选择的类型？*<br />
1. Directional selection `单向性选择`<br />
2. Stabilizing selection `稳定性选择`<br />
3. Disruptive selection `稳定型选择`<br />

## 3. What is Hardy-Weinberg principle？
*什么是哈迪-温伯格平衡定律？*<br />
**The Hardy-Weinberg Principle:**<br />
Gene frequencies will remain the same in
<u>successive generations</u> `连续世代` of a sexually reproducing population if the following five
conditions hold:<br />
A. Random mating `随机交配`<br />
B. There is no mutation `没有变异`<br />
C. The population is very large <br />
D. There is no selection<br />
E. There is no migrations `迁移` (isolated  `隔离` from other populations)

## 4. Speciation and mechanisms?
*种化和他的机理？*<br />
**Speciation:** splitting `分裂，裂开` of one species
into 2 different species.<br />
1. **Allopatric speciation** `异域种化` (probably most vertebrates `脊椎动物`): <u>allopatric species occupy areas separated by time or space</u> `
异源物种占据由时间或空间分隔的区域。`.<br />
2. **Sympatric speciation** `同域种化` (especially plants and insects): Sympatric species occupy the same place at the same time.
>**Premating 交配前隔离 mechanisms**
Habitat selection; <u>temporal isolation</u> `时间隔离`;
behavior or mechanical or structure
incompatibility `不相容，不协调`<br />
**Postmating 交配后隔离 mechanisms**
Genetic barrier such as hybrids `杂交生物体` are sterile `不育的`;
seed abortion `不育`; <u>hybrid inviability</u> `杂合子不育`.
# 5. What are the five causes of evolution?
*进化的5个原因是什么？*<br />
<center> Five Causes of evolution </center>

1. **Mutations** `基因突变` <br />
2. **Gene flow** `基因流动`-<u>Emigration and
immigration</u> `迁入迁出` of individuals (Flow of alleles `等位基因`)<br />
3. **Genetic Drift** `遗传漂变`–Changes in the gene
pool of a small population due to chance `偶然性`<br />
4. **Nonrandom `非随机的` mating**: (AA mates AA, Aa)<br />
5. **Natural selection**
