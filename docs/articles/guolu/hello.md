# **Groundwater-Making the Invisible Visible**

# **1.World Water Day**

World Water Day, held on 22 March every year since 1993, focuses on the importance of freshwater.This 2022, the focus is groundwater, an invisible resource with an impact visible everywhere.

# **2.Why should we care about groundwater?**

- Groundwater is being over-used in many areas, where more water is abstracted from aquifers than is recharged by rain and snow.
- Groundwater pollution is a particular problem that can take decades or even centuries to recover from.
- Groundwater feeds springs, rivers, lakes and wetlands, and seeps into oceans.
- Life would not be possible without groundwater. Most arid areas of the world depend entirely on groundwater. Groundwater supplies a large proportion of the water we use for drinking, sanitation, food production and industrial processes.
- Exploring, protecting and sustainably using groundwater will be central to surviving and adapting to climate change and meeting the needs of a growing population.
- Almost all of the liquid freshwater in the world is groundwater.
- About 40 per cent of all the water used for irrigation comes from aquifers.
- Asia and the Pacific region has the lowest per capita water availability in the world, with groundwater use in the region predicted to increase 30 per cent by 2050.

# 3.What about us?

There is a shortage of water resources in China, especially in some areas in the north. Due to overdraft ground water, a series of problems such as land subsidence and ecological degradation have been caused.

# 4.The harm of overusing groundwater

- Threaten the safety of water supply
- Lead to ecosystem degradation
- Induced geological disasters
- Cause seawater intrusion

# 5**.What can we do about groundwater?**

- Take shorter showers
- Turn off the water while brushing your teeth
- Use your automatic washing machine only for full loads only
- When you drink water from a glass only take as much as you need
- If you see a leak you can’t fix.Tell a parent, teacher, employer, or property manager, or call a handyman.
- Look into water recycling option at home and school
- **Adhere to waste classification,Don't throw harmful rubbish into the water**
- **Be an advocate of water conservation,Introduce water-saving knowledge to others**
- Be a defender of water conservation,If you find some outward signs of excessive water consumption.Stop it in time.

# 6.Summary

Please keep in mind that the groundwater needs to be seen.Between the i**nvisible and visible**

is bright future for human beings.So let’s take actions to protect our planet
